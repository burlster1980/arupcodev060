Market explorer is additional $200 per month and includes the analytics piece

Quite useful from a comparison perspective, and insight into the different type of traffic etc

Traffic analytics - data accuracy depends on lifespan of company in question

Can access historical data and isolate via country

The detail here is fanstastic in terms of in depth examination of rivals etc - drill down to traffic source, location, pages, etc

Does this cost extra?

Need guru level subscription for historical data - this is $200 per month

Looking at $400 per month - $4800

SEO 

Can drill down to what rivals are using in terms of keywords, cost and difficulty

Compare keyword profiles side by side i.e. competitor analysis - compare how we're ranking against people, so we know if its important i.e. Bechtel first / we're 90th for project management

CAn compare paid against organic so can see if someone is paying for them, or if we should consider paying etc

CAn see competitor paid keyword

SEO toolkit

can drill down into words that relate to the original seedword - to get new ideas as well as see difficulty etc of these

Question tab - what triggers google questions

Content marketing - this is about writing content that answers qwuestions relating to our industry - for example, what is the world's tallest building?

Keyword manager - track words that you're interested 

Position tracking - track how you're doing against competitors - would defintiely allow us to show progress / or not. This would be great for doing revamps etc as we can 

SEO writing assistant can be integrated with google docs - this couldbe awesome as a constant reminder of how you're doing - if we're writing purely from an SEO perspective

Concerns

Do we have the time and resource to use this? its great - and $400 per month isnt that much, but i feel like this is a full time job
