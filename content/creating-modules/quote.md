			<p>The Quote module allows you to add styled quotes to pages on arup.com. These standout from standard formatting, and allow you to highlight important statements or ideas in your copy</p>

			<h2>3. How does the Quote module work?</h2>
			<p>The Quote module allows you to add an attributable quote block to your page. Its style is designed to actively highlight and draw attention to the quote.</p>
			<p>The module takes details either from a 'Profile' item (for people you quote who work for Arup) or from details directly added to the module for people who do not work for Arup.</p>
			<p><b>NB - only Arup staff should be added as profiles. See the <a href="/creating-pages/profiles">Profiles guide</a> for more information.</b></p>

			<h2>4. Where can you use the quotes?</h2>
			<p>The Quote module can be placed on the following types of pages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Events</li>
				<li>News items</li>
				<li>Perspectives</li>
				<li>Projects</li>
				<li>Services</li>

			<h2>5. Creating a quote module</h2>
			<p>To add a Quote module to your page, you must first create it in the Content Editor. You will use the Experience Editor to add the completed module to your page.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Right click on the 'Local content' folder and choose 'Insert &gt; Quote' from the popup</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="halfbleed__detail">
				Fig 2: Adding a Quote module to the 'Local content' folder
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Give your Quote a suitably descriptive name and click 'Ok'. NB - if you're adding multiple quotes, its useful to number these in the order you're going to add them</li>
			</ul>
			<h5><a id="adding-content" name="adding-content"></a>Adding content (Arup staff)</h5>
			<p>You can add content to the following fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Title</b> - this is an optional field. If you add a title, it will be displayed as a heading above your quote</li>
				<li><b>Body</b>* - Enter the copy for your quote here</li>
				<li><b>Person</b> - select the staff member that you want to associate with your quote. Double click on their name - and this should then be moved to the right hand column under 'selected' (see the screenshot below). You can only select one name per quote. NB - please see the FAQ below if a profile does not exist</li>

			</div>
			<h5><a id="adding-content-not" name="adding-content-not"></a>Adding content (Non staff)</h5>
			<p>If the person you're quoting does not work at Arup, then you should add content in the following way:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Title</b> - this is an optional field. If you add a title, it will be displayed as a heading above your quote</li>
				<li><b>Body</b>* - enter the copy for your quote here</li>
				<li><b>Person</b> - ignore this field. Instead, scroll down the module until you locate the field entitled 'Name of person quoted'</li>
				<li><b>Name of person quoted</b> - enter the name of the person you're quoting</li>
				<li><b>Job title of person quoted</b> - enter the job title and or employer of the person you're quoting</li>
				<li>
					<b>Picture of person quoted</b> - you can upload a picture of your person directly via this field. The picture should be resized so the width and height are equal and it should be no larger than 450px by 450px. For advice on preparing imagery please see the <a href="/getting-started/image-preparation/">image guide</a>.

			<h5><a id="cta" name="cta"></a>Adding a call to action</h5>
			<p>It is possible to add a bespoke call to action to your quote that encourages the user to go somewhere else on arup.com to find further information. This would generally involve linking to the profile page of the person giving the quote. To add this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Click on the option 'Insert link' under the 'Link' field - this will open a popup window</li>
				<li>In the popup window, browse to the page you want to link to - all pages will be found by under '<b>Content &gt; Arup &gt; Home</b>'. Use the black triangle icon to expand out the options.</li>
				<li>Once you've selected your page, you need to add text to the field 'Link Description' - this should be a short statement such as 'Find out more about Paolo' or 'Learn more' etc</li>
				<li>Once you've added your link and Link Description, click 'OK' - you'll then see the page you've selected appearing in the 'Link' field of your Quote module</li>
			</ul>
			<h5><a id="styling" name="styling"></a>Styling your quote</h5>
			<p>As we've already seen, there are three potential styles for your quote. Below you will find details of each of these and how to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Considerations when choosing your style</b></p>
			<p>Please bear the following in mind when choosing your quote style</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Does the person you're quoting work for Arup? If they don't, then the best option is the 'Pull' quote - this won't display a picture / job title etc for the quote</li>
				<li>Does the person's profile have all the relevant information added? Does it have a picture? Is the person's name and job title correct?</li>
				<li>Are you using multiple quotes on your page? Having multiple different styles of quotes on the page can be jarring. You should be consistent with the quote styles that you choose on each page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><a href="#what-is">View the individual quote styles above</a></p>
			<p><b>NB - do not attempt to select both Pull and Large quote options at the same time as this will break the module and cause errors.</b></p>

			<h2>Best practice</h2>
			<p>In this section, you will find guidance and advice on how to best utilise the 'Quote' module.</p>
			<p>It includes examples illustrating how to use and display the module.</p>
			<p><b>NB - It is highly recommended that you DO NOT use the 'Pull' style quote when adding quotes to your page. This is because it offers no quote attribution and is not visually pleasing. GMC is exploring this option's removal.</b></p>
			<h5>Recommended use</h5>
			<ul class="featureList">
				<li class="tick">Display quotes from Arup employees</li>
				<li class="tick">Highlight key elements of content to draw readers' attention</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Example 1 - correctly presented 'default' quote</b></p>
			<p>In the example below, you'll see what a 'perfect' example of a quote in default display mode looks like.</p>

			</ol>
			<h5><a id="faq-when" name="faq-when"></a>1. When should I use the different styles of quote?</h5>
			<p>A. Each of the different quote styles offers different display options. The most significant outlier is the 'Pull quote' as this does not include information about the person you're quoting. This works best when you do not have a profile for the person you're quoting.</p>
			<p>Ultimately the style of quote you use is decision you need to make when building your page.</p>
			<h5><a id="faq-should" name="faq-should"></a>2. Should I use different styles of quotes in the same article?</h5>
			<p>A. Ideally you should be consistent in a single page or article in your use of quotes. Using all three styles in the same page could be draining on the user and make them work harder.</p>
			<h5><a id="faq-quoting" name="faq-quoting"></a>3. I'm quoting an Arup staff member but a profile doesn't already exist on arup.com. What should I do?</h5>
			<p>A. Ideally, you should create a profile to hold the relevant data for your quote (see the <a href="/creating-pages/creating-profiles/">Profile guide</a> for further information on this). If this is not feasible, then you should instead use the 'Pull quote' to display your quote.</p>
			<h5><a id="faq-notstaff" name="faq-notstaff"></a>4. I'm quoting a non-member of Arup staff. What should I do?</h5>
			<p>A. You should NOT create a profile for non-staff members. Profiles should be exclusively reserved for those that work at Arup.</p>
			<p>You should instead enter the details of the person you're quoting directly into the fields provided on the Quote module.</p>
			<h5><a id="faq-noimage" name="faq-noimage"></a>5. My quotee's profile does not have an image. What should I do?</h5>
			<p>A. Ideally, you should source an image from the person you're quoting (if they work for Arup) and add this to the relevant profile. If you're unable to do this, please use either the default quote layout or the 'Pull quote' layout.</p>
			<h5><a id="faq-all" name="faq-all"></a>6. Should I put all the quotes from my article in the quote module?</h5>
			<p>A. You can use multiple quotes in a single article. However, you should consider how this looks on the page. Ultimately the Quote module is designed to highlight particularly important elements of your content.</p>
			<p>You do NOT have to contain quotes within the module. You can add a quote into the Rich Text module using simple quotation marks. Think about how other websites you use - particularly news sites - use quotes in their articles.</p>
