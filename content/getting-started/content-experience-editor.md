			<h2>1. Introduction to Sitecore</h2>
			<p>Sitecore is the Content Management System (CMS) used to power arup.com. It allows trained staff to access arup.com and edit or add new content to the site, track user behaviours and personalise content based on user characteristics.</p>
			<p>The platform is owned and managed by the GMC Online team. The key contacts in the team include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="mailto:steve.burleigh@arup.com">Steve Burleigh, Web Manager</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="mailto:emma.kennedy@arup.com">Emma Kennedy, Communications Co-ordinator</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The team are responsible for a range of support and advice in using Sitecore, including:</p>
			<ul>

			<h2>2. Definitions and terms</h2>
			<p>The below list contains a number of definitions for specific terms relating to Sitecore and used throughout this guide.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Item</b> - Every unique element in Sitecore is referred to as an 'item'. For example, images are 'media library items'. Pages are items (for example 'project item'). Often these terms are used interchangeably for example the guide may refer to a 'project item' or a 'project document / page' etc</li>
				<li><b>Modules</b> - modules are the components used to build page layouts within Sitecore.</li>
				<li><b>Buckets</b> - these are storage items used within Sitecore for storing large numbers of similar items. They are effectively folders.</li>
				<li><b>Content editor</b> - Area of Sitecore where you can add pages, edit content and upload media</li>
				<li><b>Experience Editor</b> - Unique to Sitecore, functionality that allows you to build page layouts utilising modules</li>
				<li><b>Placeholder</b> - name given to the area on a page in which you can insert / add a module</li>

			<h2>3. The CMS - Content editor</h2>
			<p>Sitecore offers two methods for adding and editing content. To use the platform successfully, you'll need to make use of both on a regular basis. This section focuses on the CMS / content editor element of the platform which is similar to many other CMS' you may have previously come across.</p>
			<h5><a id="accessing" name="accessing"></a>Accessing Sitecore and logging</h5>
			<p>If you've been granted access to Sitecore by the GMC Online team, then you can access Sitecore by visiting the link below and entering your username and password:</p>
			<p><a href="https://sitecore.arup.com/sitecore/login" target="_blank">http://sitecore.arup.com/sitecore/login</a></p>
			<p>If you've not yet been granted access, then you'll need to contact either <a href="mailto:steve.burleigh@arup.com">Steve Burleigh</a> or <a href="mailto:emma.kennedy@arup.com">Emma Kennedy</a> and outline the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why you need access</li>
				<li>What kind of content you'll be creating or editing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Wherever possible, GMC Online will attempt to run an in person or online training session before giving you access to the CMS.</p>

			<h5><a id="browsing" name="browsing"></a>Browing pages in the Content Editor</h5>
			<p>To explore pages in the Content Editor you need to utilise the 'content tree' to find individual pages. The content tree is located in the left hand pane of the screen. You can view an item by clicking on it within this pane. You can explore items that sit below a 'parent' by clicking the black triangle icon you'll see (highlighted in the screenshot below). This icon indicates that items sit below a visible item.</p>
			<p>To access pages, you'll need to browse to '<b>Content &gt; Arup &gt; Home &gt;</b>'. Please note, you will not always be able to edit items in the content tree. In General, you will not be able to edit key landing pages such as the 'Home' or 'Expertise' page. What you can edit will depend on what tasks you've been granted permision to undertake. You can however see every page within the content tree.</p>

			<h5><a id="buckets" name="buckets"></a>Buckets</h5>
			<p>Sitecore uses a method called 'Buckets' to store pages when there are significant numbers of similar content types. For example, there are over 1500 project pages on Arup.com. To help you browse these and find what you're looking for, these are ordered alphabetically into Buckets. A bucket is essentially a folder that stores these pages.</p>
			<p>If you're new to Sitecore, this can be a confusing concept - and you may find that you're unable to view the contents of these buckets. This section details where buckets are used, and also how to ensure you can see their contents.</p>
			<p><b>Where are buckets found?</b></p>
			<p>Buckets are currently used for the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="/creating-pages/creating-projects/">Projects</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/creating-pages/creating-perspectives/">Perspectives</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/creating-pages/creating-profiles/">Profiles</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/creating-pages/creating-news/">News articles</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can access individual guides on how to build these page types by clicking on the links above.</p>

			<p>If you're new to Sitecore, you may find that you cannot view the contents of Buckets straight away. If when looking at Projects you don't see a list of folders as shown in the screenshot above, please follow the steps outlined below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Click the 'View' tab at the top of the screen (highlighted below)</li>
				<li>Ensure that the 'Buckets' option is checked</li>
				<li>Try browsing to 'Projects again' - you should see that the folders are now visible</li>

			<h5><a id="functionality" name="functionality"></a>Key functionality and actions</h5>
			<p>In this section, you will find details on some of the key things you can do in the Content Editor - along with the links to more detailed guidance for specific activities.</p>
			<p><b>Build page items</b></p>
			<p>For the majority of content editors, you will be able to create the following types of pages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Events</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/creating-pages/creating-news/">News - read the guide</a>
				</li>
				<li>

			<p><b>Edit existing content</b></p>
			<p>You can also edit existing content - mostly from the list identified above. Whilst these guides are written from the perspective of creating each page item from scratch, they will also aid you in editing an existing page if necessary.</p>
			<p><b>Workflow and submitting your content for publication</b></p>
			<p>All pages in Sitecore are managed by a workflow. This essentially means that you can 'lock' a page whilst you edit, to prevent others interfering with your work. It also means that only select staff can publish content to the live site.</p>
			<p>You can find full details on the workflow by reading the <a href="/getting-started/workflow/">workflow guide</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Upload and add images to your content</b></p>
			<p>You can upload images to use in your content and store these within Sitecore's media library.</p>
			<p>The following guidance helps support this process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="/getting-started/image-preparation/">Preparing imagery for use online</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/getting-started/uploading/">Uploading images to Sitecore</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Create and prepare modules for use on your pages</b></p>
			<p>The majority of page types on arup.com utilise an extensive library of modules. These are items you can add to a page for displaying content in different ways - for example quotes or images.</p>

</section>
<section class="container" id="">
	<div class="rich-text">
		<div class="reveal rich-text__content">
			<p>You can create a range of these modules within the Content Editor. You can find <a href="/creating-modules/">guidance on creating and editing each module type</a> available via this training site.</p>
			<p><b>Access the Experience Editor and preview pages</b></p>
			<p>When working on a page in the Content Editor, you can choose to view it in either the Experience Editor, or in 'preview' mode.</p>
			<p>If you're building a page from scratch, you're likely going to access the Experience Editor rather than preview - as the former is where you'll design your page layout.</p>
			<p>The screenshot below indicates how to access the Experience Editor.</p>

			<p><b>Create multiple language versions of your content</b></p>
			<p>Sitecore gives you the ability to add separate language versions of each page on the website if you wish or require it. Whilst all pages must be initially created in English, you can subsequently add versions in a range of languages including French, Spanish, German, Chinese and Japanese.</p>
			<p>For full guidance on creating language versions and the complete list of languages available, please see the <a href="/getting-started/language-versions/">Language versions guide</a>.</p>

			<h2>4. The Experience Editor</h2>
			<p>The Experience Editor is a key part of Sitecore. In essence, it is a visual tool that allows you to build unique layouts for your pages - by adding modules to the page in the order that you require. You can see the page develop visually as you add these modules, giving you the chance to refine or alter your layout depending on what works best for your content.</p>
			<h5><a id="accessing-experience" name="accessing-experience"></a>Accessing the Experience Editor</h5>
			<p>The Experience Editor will most often form the second step in your page creation / editing process. This means in most circumstances, you'll be accessing the Editor from the specific page you've been working on in the Content Editor. The screenshot below shows how to do this:</p>
			<div class="training-image"><img alt="Image" class="mainImg" src="/images/profiles/access-ee.jpg"></div>

			<p>You can access the Experience Editor from any page within arup.com and browse to a specific page whilst within the Experience Editor.</p>
			<p>You can also access the Editor via the Sitecore home screen. As detailed in <a href="#home">chapter 3 above</a>, there is a link to the Editor on the Sitecore welcome screen.</p>

			<h5><a id="adding" name="adding"></a>Adding modules to your page</h5>
			<p><b>NB - you need to create modules via the Content Editor first, before they can be added using the Experience Editor</b></p>
			<p>Each page type in the CMS contains a number of so called 'placeholders'. These are areas that have been specifically defined to allow the addition of certain modules.</p>
			<p>Adding modules to these placeholders is relatively simple, and is detailed below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When viewing the page you wish to edit within the Experience Editor, click the button marked 'Component' in the main navigation bar (circled in the screenshot below)</li>
				<li>This will reveal the 'placeholders' available on the page you're editing. Click 'Add here' to placeholder you wish to use (<b>NB - You should only use placeholders found below the main 'banner' image and above any 'related content' when editing pages</b>.)</li>
