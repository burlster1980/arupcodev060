			<h2>1. What is a profile?</h2>
			<p>Profiles are used for displaying information about individual members of staff at Arup. They include key contact information and details about that person's experience, interests and work they've carried at Arup.</p>
			<p>You should only create a profile for someone when you are able to provide ALL the information detailed in this guide. Do NOT create profiles without this information.</p>
			<p>When you add a profile, you should also remember that you - and your team - are responsible for the accuracy of that profile. That means ensuring both that the content is correct, but also that the person remains employed with Arup. You will need to check at least once per year.</p>

			<h2>2. Where are profiles?</h2>
			<h3>Profiles on the website</h3>
			<p>Profiles are located under the URL <a href="https://www.arup.com/our-firm/paolo-cresci" target="_blank">www.arup.com/our-firm/profile-name</a></p>
			<p>At the time of writing, there is no one page where a user can see all staff members. Profiles will be revealed to users in one of three ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>By searching Google / Bing etc for a staff member's name and clicking a specific result</li>
				<li>By searching for a staff member's name on arup.com</li>
				<li>By clicking a link to a profile within content (for example the utility bar)</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Profiles within the CMS</h3>
			<p>Profiles are 'bucketable' and stored in Sitecore 'Buckets'. Buckets are essentially Sitecore terminology for folders. They allow the CMS to store content in a folder structure, making things easier to find. A bucket's name does not appear in the URL of a page.</p>
			<p>Profiles are stored in the following way:</p>
			<p><b>Our firm &gt; Letter (i.e. 'A') &gt; Name of profile</b></p>
			<p>This means that when you create a new Profile item, it will be stored in letter 'bucket' corresponding to the first letter of the profilee's name. For example, a profile called 'Steve Burleigh' would be stored as follows:</p>
			<p><b>Our firm &gt; S &gt; Steve Burleigh</b></p>

			<h2>3. Creating a profile</h2>
			<p>To create a news article, you will need to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Right click on 'Our firm' and choose 'Insert &gt; Person profile'</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="training-image"><img alt="Image" class="mainImg" src="/images/profiles/create-profile.jpg"></div>
			<div class="halfbleed__detail">
				Fig1: Creating a new Profile item. You need to right click on the 'Our firm' node, and choose 'Insert &gt; Person profile'
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Enter the name of the person who's profile you're creating for example 'Steve Burleigh'</li>
				<li>Click 'OK' and your profile will be created and assigned to the 'S' bucket</li>
			</ul>
			<h3><a id="adding" name="adding"></a>Adding content to your profile item</h3>
			<p>Virtually all content you add to a profile will be added via the CMS interface. Profiles make only very limited use of modules and you cannot add multiple modules in the way you would for a News or Project item.</p>
			<p>Only one type of module can be added and full instructions on this are provided below.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A profile MUST be created in English first</li>

			<h3><a id="workflow" name="workflow"></a>Workflow</h3>
			<p>Profiles are covered by the CMS' workflow. This means that only certain staff are able to publish content. Generally, this will be a member of the GMC Online team - though some regions including Australasia and the Far East also have a member of staff with publishing rights.</p>

			<h2><a id="concept" name="concept"></a>4. Job titles</h2>
			<P>Many staff have multiple job titles. The Profile template can only hold one single job title. To address this, functionality has been developed that allows for the addition of mulitple job titles - for use in different parts of the website.</P>
			<p>For example <A href="https://www.arup.com/our-firm/fiona-cousins" target="_blank">Fiona Cousins' profile</A> shows her job title as 'Director'. Fiona has a number of different roles (at the time of writing) including Americas Digital Leader, Americas Mechanical Engineering, and being a board member and Fellow. The following screenshots show you how her profile is being used in each of the above areas:</p>

			<h3><a id="adding-title" name="adding-title"></a>Adding job titles / roles</h3>
			<P>The following examples provides an illustration of when you would need to create an additional job title.</P>
			<p>You've created a profile for 'Mike Smith' as he is the contact for a project you've added. Mike is an Associate Director, and the civil engineering leader in the UK. For people who view the project, you want people to know that he is the UK Civil Engineering Leader.</p>
			<P>You've added a new Perspective article written by Fiona Cousins on the subject of digital technology. Fiona's job title in her profile is set to 'Director' - but for the purposes of the article, you want her to be known as the 'Americas Digital Leader'.</P>
			<p>To add a new role to a person's profile, you need to:</p>
			<UL>
				<li>Select the profile of the person you wish to add the role to</li>
				<lI>Right click on their name and choose '<b>Insert > Role</b>'</lI>
			</UL>
			<div class="training-image"><img alt="Image" class="mainImg" src="/images/profiles/creating-role.jpg"></div>
			<div class="halfbleed__detail">

				<lI>The screen will re-load and the new 'role' will be presented on your screen with three avaialble fields</lI>
			</uL>
			<h3>Adding content to the 'role'</h3>
			<P>The 'role' item contains three fields:</P>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Title:</b> This field is automatically populated with the name of the Item you created - ensure to check that this is correct</li>
				<li><B>Email:</B> You can add an alternative email address - this should match the job title you're creating. For example, if the job title relates to 'digital', you should an appropriate digital email address i.e. digital@arup.com. NEVER use personal email addresses.</li>
				<li><b>Telephone:</b> You can add an alternative phone number for the person</li>

			<h2>5. Best practice</h2>
			<p>You can see an example of a well-presented profile item by looking at an <a href="/best-practive/examplar-profile/">exemplar profile</a>. (link to item).</p>
			<p>You should bear in mind the following when adding profiles to arup.com:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Profiles are key content items on arup.com. Ultimately staff represent Arup's key resource and profiles are how we bring this to life online</li>
				<lI>Profiles are to be written in the first person - for example 'I am a civil engineer' or 'I am the leader of Arup's architecture practice in the Americas'
				<li>Profiles should only ever be created for Arup staff. You must NOT create profiles for non-staff members</li>
				<li>Profiles should always have as much information as possible. At a minimum, a profile should have:
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Picture</li>
						<li>Job title</li>
						<li>Contact details</li>
						<li>A brief biography</li>
						<li>Details of industry and service experience</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>When completing the 'job title' field you should only use roles such as 'Director', 'Principal, 'Associate' or 'Senior engineer' etc. This value should match what is used for the person on the Arup intranet.</li>
				<lI>The summary field should always include reference to the person's specialism and any specific roles they play. For example:<br/><br/>
					<i>I am a chartered civil engineer, with over 15 years experience. I am currently the Americas Civil Engineering Leader, whilst I am also the Infrastructure Leader for Canada.</i><br/><br/>
				<li>Use the biography to bring the person's story to life and highlight their experience</li>
				<li>Don't forget to add related content - particularly projects - wherever possible. Highlighting projects in this way helps to bring a user's skills and experience to life</li>
