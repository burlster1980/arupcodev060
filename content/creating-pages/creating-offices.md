			<h2>1. Where are offices?</h2>
			<h5><a id="website" name="website"></a>Offices on the website</h5>
			<p>When viewing the website, offices can be found under the URL <a href="https://www.arup.com/offices" target="_blank">www.arup.com/offices</a></p>
			<h5><a id="cms" name="cms"></a>Offices within the CMS</h5>
			<p></p>
			<p>When viewing the CMS, offices are found at <b>Sitecore &gt; Content &gt; Arup &gt; Home &gt; Offices</b></p>
			<p>Individual offices (for example 'London') are located underneath the relevant country i.e. United Kingdom.</p>
			<p>An individual office is stored in the following way:</p>
			<p><b>Offices &gt; Country name &gt; Local content &gt; Offices &gt; Office name</b></p>

			<h2>2. Creating a new office item</h2>
			<p>Before proceeding please be aware that you should never create a new country within the CMS. If your office sits outside of existing countries, please contact the GMC Online team first.</p>
			<P>Additionally, you are strongly advised to discuss the creation of any new offices with GMC first as well - this is to ensure that there is global alignment on promoting information.</P>
			<p>To create a new office you will need to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Browse to 'Offices' in the content tree, and expand this to reveal countries</li>
				<li>Expand the country you wish to add an office to - then expand the 'Local content' folder that resides under the country</li>
				<li>Right click on the 'Office' item sitting in Local content and choose '<b>Insert &gt; Office</b>'</li>
			</ul>

				<li>Enter the office location (city) and click OK</li>
				<li>The screen will then reload, and you've successfully created your office item and are ready to begin adding content</li>

			<h5><a id="completing" name="completing"></a>Completing your office item</h5>
			<p>Once you have added the data detailed above, you should save your document. You can now submit it for publication or preview it using the method outlined below.</p>
			<h5><a id="links" name="links"></a>Adding links in Sitecore</h5>
			<p>You can add links to content in certain fields. Fields on an office you can add links to include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Content</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please see the '<a href="/getting-started/adding-links/">Adding links in Sitecore</a>' guide for more information on adding links.</p>
			<h5><a id="language" name="language"></a>Adding an alternative language version</h5>
			<p>Sitecore gives you the ability to add multiple language versions to your content. A full guide to language versions has been provided, but you should be aware that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An article MUST be created in English first</li>
				<li>Any modules that have been added to your news item will also require translated versions be created</li>
			</ul>

			<h5><a id="workflow" name="workflow"></a>Workflow</h5>
			<p>Office items are covered by the CMS' workflow. This means that only certain staff are able to publish content. Generally, this will be a member of the GMC Online team - though some regions including Australasia and the Far East also have a member of staff with publishing rights. You can <a href="/getting-started/workflow/">learn more about the workflow via the online guide</a></p>

			<h2>3. Best practice</h2>
			<p>You can see an example of a well-presented office page by <a href="/best-practice/exemplar-office/">looking at an exemplar office</a>.</p>
			<p>You should bear in mind the following when adding offices to arup.com:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your introduction / summary content is vital - try not to make this content too long, summarise your office succinctly. You can use the related projects area to highlight key projects by your office, rather than the rich text area.</li>
				<li>Another reason to avoid lengthy office descriptions: the narrow width of the columns for rich text means that a long intro could hide the related projects content, which encourages users to explore the site further.</li>
				<li>Make sure that the office address and contact details are present, correct and up to date. This information is vital for users.</li>
				<li>Ensure that related projects for the office have been selected - it is better to show these are related content (see below or example) than a collection of links in your office description</li>
				<li>Ensure that any news specifically relating to your office has been selected</li>
				<lI>You need to keep 'related content' up to date. Because this content is manually selected, it will remain permanently in place until you or a colleague change it. It is important to remember this and ensure that you update it once publishing important news or projects etc.</lI>

			<h5>1. I want a different image to display at the top of my office page</h5>
			<p>A. The office pages live on the country page and therefore share the same header image as the country header.</p>
			<h5><a id="modules" name="modules"></a>2. Why can't I add any modules to the office page?</h5>
			<p>A. Office pages are a standard template, therefore you can't add any modules to it.</p>
			<h5><a id="profile" name="profile"></a>3. Why does the office lead require an arup.com profile?</h5>
			<p>A. We want to show our expertise and encourage users to contact our professionals where possible. The CMS also won't allow you to select a profile lead without an associated profile.</p>
