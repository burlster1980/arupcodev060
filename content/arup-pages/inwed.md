                <h4>What makes you proud?</h4><p> 
I am working on creating a Digital Twin for an office building – to improve its energy, comfort and utilization performance. It will help the building become energy neutral by 2040.</p><P>
A Digital Twin is a new modelling paradigm, one that uses a convergence IoT sensor data, modelling, simulation and machine learning to provide previously unthinkable levels of ongoing operational control, asset performance management and insight. It will create a living’ digital counterpart that is subjected to the same environment and user-interaction, helping to provide accurate feedback on its performance.
</P><h4>Why engineering? </h4>
<p>What drives me is the idea that we can create a positive change with the projects we work on. This makes the work interesting and rewarding and it inspires and motivates me. I like working together to figure out how technical innovations can be brought together to help shape a more environmentally friendly and healthy future. 
</P><h4>The future..</h4><p>
The puzzle is becoming so complicated that no one can solve it by him- or herself. It needs all different specialisms and different skills to come together and it requires an environment in which people also feel empowered and understand that the puzzle piece they hold is just as important as any other. </p>

Why engineering?</h4><p>
Engineers apply a multidisciplinary approach that connects high level strategies and intangible problems to tangible solutions that can be measured, monitored and improved over time.  You can see and touch the results of our work and the interaction with its environmental, social and economic impact. It is very real. </p><h4>
The future..</h4><p>
Transition towards sustainable development for me is the main driver. The UN SDGs are an enabler towards real sustainability where everyone, from governments to companies or individuals have a role to play and a responsibility. Being part of this transformation opens a wide range of opportunities to work in new areas and maximize our impact, supporting our role in the shaping a better world.
