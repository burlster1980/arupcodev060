			<P>
			We proposed that all three bridges be cable-supported with central towers of different shapes. This would provide a variety between each as well as a visual affinity.
			</P>
			<p>
			 To minimise the environmental impact, single column peers were used - this ensured that the obstruction to water flow would be minimised.
			</p>-->
			<p>Arup’s involvement in the main section in the Zhuhai waters started in 2009 when we carried out the concept and preliminary design in a joint venture with China Highway and Planning Design Institute and other firms.
</p><p>
The main section comprises three navigation channel bridges: Jiuzhou, Jianghai and Qingzhou. As the link would be so prominent a unique and aesthetic design was highly desired, whilst resilience and sustainability were also high on the agenda to address concerns such as frequent typhoons and habitats of dolphins.
</p><P>
All the three bridges were proposed to be cable-supported with central towers of different shapes placed between the carriageways to give both a visual affinity and variety between the bridges. From environmental considerations, single column piers were used to support the structure with piles buried in the seabed. This minimises obstruction to water flow and impact on the habitat of the Chinese white dolphins.
</P><P>
At the detailed design stage, the design of all three bridges were revisited and the Jiuzhou Bridge has been retained in its original form with sail-type towers.

			<h2>A record breaking tunnnel</h2>
			<p>
			When it came to connecting parts of Hong Kong – including Hong Kong International Airport – with the HKBCF, designers faced a new set of challenges. The link road, officially known as the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link, includes a combination of viaducts and a sub-sea tunnel.
			</p>
			<p>
			Arup provided multidisciplinary design for this tunnel. Working with Dragages Bouygues Joint Venture, we helped deliver a safe and sustainable design which included the use of a world-record external diameter of 17.6m for a Tunnel Boring Machine – at the time the largest ever used in construction.
			</p>
			<p>
			In order to provide sufficient working space for such a huge machine, we had to design the first cellular diaphragm wall cofferdam ever used in Hong Kong. This provided an open, strut free environment and has since been adopted by a number of other projects.

			<h2>Delivering improvements</h2>
			<p>
			Envisioning, designing and delivering such a mega structure represents the highest of engineering challenge. But ensuring that it delivers for its users is just as important.
			</p>
			<p>
			The crossing provides a major improvement in connectivity between Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macau. Journey times between Hong Kong and Zhuhai have been reduced by over 80%. At the same time, links between these locations and Hong Kong International Airport have significantly improved – helping the government to deliver its vision of regional aviation hub.
			</p>
			<p>
			The new crossing and associated link roads have also been designed to help alleviate pressure on existing connections – with aim of improving local journeys for those not even using the crossing.
